'''Function in python is a group of related statements that perform a specific task. 

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks .As our program grows larger and larger , functions make it more organized and manageble'''

 Categories of Functions:
1. Built-in: int() float() input() eval() len() type() min()/max() abs() round() range()

2. Modules:
        A file containing functions and variables defined in seperate files.
        A module is simply a file that contains Python Code.
        When we break a program into modules, each module should contain functions that perform related tasks.
    math()
    random()
    string()
