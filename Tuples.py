#----------------------Tuples in python------------------------

''' Like in strings we can not alter its elements(characters) , similarly in tuples also we cannot alter the elements . That is they are immutable'''
 
''' s="Ankita"
 s[0]='v'
 print(s)  #error 
 
'''
b=['A','B','C']
b[0]='v'
print(b)  #works

''' Tuples  are immutable.:elements if a tuple cannot bne changed once it has been assigned
 tuple is created by placing all the items inside parenthesis(),seperated by commas.
 The parenthesis are optional, however, it is a good practie to use them'''

c=('a','b','c','d')
print(c)
  

  #functions will be same as lists
